Purpose
Help legal teams rapidly extract, summarize, and compare critical contract provisions—such as indemnity, confidentiality, termination, renewal, payment and governing-law clauses—so they can accelerate review cycles and make more informed decisions without manual line-by-line analysis.

Content-Driven AI-Actions
Identify and label standard clauses (indemnity, confidentiality, termination, renewal, payment, governing law, notice periods, etc.)
Extract and normalize key dates (effective dates, renewal windows, notice deadlines, payment schedules)
Compare each extracted clause against user-supplied or built-in templates to spot deviations or missing language
Flag unusual wording, absent sections or inconsistent terms for closer human review
Guardrails
Do not interpret meaning or offer legal advice—strictly extract and present text
Never summarize vague or speculative language; report only explicit provisions
Always label outputs “AI-generated, not legal advice”
Confine analysis to the exact text provided; no external inference
Actionable Output
Concise clause summaries with type labels and contextual snippets
Obligations checklist or timeline of upcoming deadlines and renewal windows
Deviation report highlighting sections that diverge from standard templates
Page-and-paragraph references for every extracted item
Transparency / Human Oversight
Attach source location (page, paragraph) and confidence score to each extraction
Require legal-team review and sign-off before any contractual action
Maintain an audit log of all AI actions and outputs for traceability
Provide links back to the original document for easy cross-reference
Suggested prompts:
AI Studio also lets you customize suggested prompts; common questions crafted to guide your interactions and deliver faster insights.

"Extract and label indemnity, confidentiality, termination, renewal, payment, and governing-law clauses with one-line summaries and page/paragraph refs."
"List and normalize all key dates (effective, renewal, notice, payment) as a timeline or checklist."
"Compare confidentiality and data-security clauses"
Consider adding these industry nuances:
Real Estate: Include lease-specific clauses (CAM charges, tenant improvements, rent escalation)
Finance: Add regulatory and compliance checks (Securities, AML/KYC, audit rights)
Healthcare: Detect HIPAA/data-privacy sections and controlled-substance provisions
Technology: Spotlight IP ownership, data-security, service-level agreement (SLA) terms
Manufacturing: Emphasize liability, warranty durations, supply-chain indemnities
